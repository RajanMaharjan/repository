1.When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
um.. I will use this remote repository for working in project with other.. my friends.

2.Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
As we want to work in the project as we desired, we want to pull the part of the project we can work with manually instead of automatically updating.

3.Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are done in the github with is remotly but clones are done locally on own computer we can work offline in it contrast to forks and branches are the
different parts of the coding with is done independently.
