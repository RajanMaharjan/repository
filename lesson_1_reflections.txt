1.How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It help me to find the bug but was time consuming.

2.How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
We can always keep track of our mistakes and learn from them and improve our programming skills.

3.What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
It your own way of codeing where you benifit with you can easily know the places you likely commit. There won't too much of the commits so that you will be cumbersome to look at those log to find out the specific bug.

4.Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
As, it is an sigle poject we want the complete runable project at the time of commit. Which is workbale version of the very project.

5.How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Simply time "git log" and "git diff id_1 id_2"

6.How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
As we are able to checkout the previous version any time we want, we can be confident enough making changes as needed.

7.Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I want to work with my won projects so that I can know the proper use of it in real projects.
